+task list

- Add an actual line instead of the debug line

- Remove the hard-coded CurrentUnit and make it actually use the one you click on

- add more Terrain

- add more hazards?

- fix random map generation to be less ugly/impossible to softlock

- add more units, *probably* by making the game generate them similar to the tile system

- add unit types/classes again, this might work really well if we make it similar to tile system

- maybe just hard code the units/classes, but if we use a system similar to the tiles (by giving each class a number)
we can allow the use to place how many of what unit they want.

- any other ideas please put in a readme or smth so we're on the same boat
